Automatic loading of generated report in the patient medical records


This is an Automatic loading of generated report in the patient medical records based on SSN regulations. Doctors can move new_producted_records (of their patients) between hospitals/departments and the SSN has visibility into the locations of all new_producted_records and all new_producted_record movements between hospitals/ departments.

This network defines:

**Participants**
`Doctor` `Ssn`

**Assets**
`New_producted_record` `Hospital_Department` `Patient`

**Transactions**
`New_producted_recordMovementDeparture` `New_producted_recordMovementArrival` `SetupDemo`

Each Doctor owns a Hospital_Department that is identified by a Single Department Identifier (SDI). A Doctor owns a set of New_producted_records. A Hospital_Department owns a set of Patients. A Patient have a Health Folder that contains a set of New_producted_records owned by the Doctor. New_producted_records can be transferred between doctors or between Hospital_Department.

To test this Network in the **Test** tab:

Submit a `SetupDemo` transaction:

{
  "$class": "org.acme.SetupDemo"
}

This transaction populates the Participant Registries with two `Doctor` participants and a `Ssn` participant. The Asset Registries will have eight `New_producted_record` assets, two `Hospital_Department` assets and four `Patient` assets.


Before starting, the NEW_PRODUCTED_RECORD_1 is in the status IN_DEPARTMENT
 

Submit a `New_producted_recordMovementDeparture` transaction:

{
  "$class": "org.acme.New_producted_recordMovementDeparture",
  "fromPatient": "resource:org.acme.Patient#PATIENT_2",
  "new_producted_record": "resource:org.acme.New_producted_record#NEW_PRODUCTED_RECORD_1",
  "from": "resource:org.acme.Hospital_Department#HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_1",
  "to": "resource:org.acme.Hospital_Department#HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_2"
}

The transaction New_producted_recordMovementDeparture moves `NEW_PRODUCTED_RECORD_1` from `PATIENT_2` (owened by DOCTOR_2) at `HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_1` to `HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_2`.
Letâ€™s imagine that HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_2 the is responsible for updating the patient's medical records
After this transaction the status become LOADING:
 

Submit a `New_producted_recordMovementArrival` transaction:

{
  "$class": "org.acme.New_producted_recordMovementArrival",
  "arrivalField": "resource:org.acme.Patient#PATIENT_1",
  "new_producted_record": "resource:org.acme.New_producted_record#NEW_PRODUCTED_RECORD_1",
  "from": "resource:org.acme.Hospital_Department#HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_1",
  "to": "resource:org.acme.Hospital_Department#HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_2"
}
 

This transaction confirms the receipt of `NEW_PRODUCTED_RECORD_1` from `HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_1` to `PATIENT_2` at `HOSPITAL_DEPARTMENT_2`.

The package that I realized includes three files:
- model
- access rules
- Script file realized in JavaScript
